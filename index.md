I am a third-year PhD candidate in Computer Vision Group, Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam under the supervision of [Prof. dr. Theo Gevers](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/th.gevers/) and [Dr. Sezer Karaoglu](https://karaoglusezer.github.io/). My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, particularly indoor scene understanding, like depth estimation and 3D scene reconstruction.

Before that, I got my Bacholar's and Master's degree from Beihang University on 2018 and 2021 respectively. During my master, I carried out research on object detection, supervised by Prof. Wei Zhao. In 2020 and 2021, I was a research intern at Meituan, focusing on object detection and image segmentation.
